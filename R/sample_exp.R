#' Exponential Fish Sampling
#' Function that samples based on exponential function. Catch probabilities depend on number
#' of fish and probabilities of catching each species. 

#'Function to fish the population
#'@param nfish1 Number of fish1
#'@param nfish2 Number of fish2
#'@param prob1 Probability of catching fish1
#'@param prob2 Probability of catching fish2
#'@param comp_coeff Competition coefficient. Higher the value the more likely to catch 
#' species1. Specified in ctl file. If NA, use other probability formulation
