#'Make Control
#'
#'Define arguments for hook and line simulations
#' Used in initialize_population
#' @param numrow Number of rows in matrix
#' @param numcol Number of columns in matrix
#' @param nfish1 Number of fish1 to allocate among matrix
#' @param nfish2 Number of fish2 to allocate among matrix
#' @param prob1 Probability of catching species 1
#' @param prob2 Probability of catching species 2
#' @param move_out_prob Probability of moving out of fishing area
#' @param seed Set seed if distribute == random, defaults to 300
#' @param distribute Specify fish distribution to be 'uniform', 'patchy', or 'area' specific
#' @param maxfish Maximum number of fish that can be sampled at a time; default is 10
#' @param percent percentage of area to sample. Only necessary if distribute == 'patchy'; default is 0.3
#' @param area Specify area to distribute fish, options are 'upperleft', 'upperright', 'lowerleft', 
#' 'lowerright', 'upperhalf', 'lowerhalf', 'righthalf', 'lefthalf'  Only necessary if distribute == 'area'
#'@param location Data frame of locations with column for vessel, rows, and columns of fish are to fish in. 
#'@param scope the scope of fishing movement, default to 1 so fish in surrounding 1 cells can move in; default is 1
#'@param nhooks number of hooks at the smallest sampling size; default is 5
#'@param ndrops number of drops, default is 5 following hook and line protocol; default is 5
#'@param nangs number of anglers, Default is 3
#'@param process specify process by which fish are sampled, options are 'multinomial', 'hypergeometric', and 'equal_prob'. 
#' 'equal_prob' is based on CIE comments from 2012.

#' @param nyear Number of years in survey; default is 10
#' @param browser Switch to turn on browser for debugging
#' @param cpue_method Method of aggregating cpue. For use in calc_cpue function. Currently
#' @param mortality Natural mortality values, can be input as single value or matrix. 
#'Percentage mortality each year if single value
#' options are 'average', '75hooks' to aggregate by hooks, and 'weighted_average' is in development.
#' @param movement_function Specify the movement function, this occurs in year 2 of the survey, defaults to no movement
#' @param max_prob Maximum movement probability for movement functions; defaults to 0.1
#' @param min_prob Minimum movement probability for movement functions; defaults to 0.1
#' @param comp_coeff Competition coefficient, how likely to catch species 1? Defaults to NA
#' @param rec_rate Recruitment rate
#' @param rec_years Years of recruitment
#' @param hs_loc Locations of hotspots
#' @param hs_scope Scope of hotspot range. Amount of diffusion of fish
#' @param delta Difference between center of hotspot and surrounding cells
